                So, I started an online course about web development a few days ago. 
                I tried to learn coding with online courses a few times before, but I never stuck with it.
                This means that prior to my current attempt, the only knowledge in coding I have are some snippets of severeal programming languages, but nothing substential.
                But I want to change that. And this time, I'm doing things differently.</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>I'm having more free time to dedicate to this learning journey.</li>
                    <li>I'm applying my new knowledge directly in my own project - this website.</li>
                </ol>
            <p>
                I will try to document my journey here. 
                Maybe I will only post updates, but I will try to share some knowledge about coding as well.
                At the moment I am learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, so if you're interested - keep posted.
