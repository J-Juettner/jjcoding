                First JavaScript Project

            Today I studied different data types and operators in JavaScript. 
            This means I learned about <i>strings</i> and <i>numbers</i> and <i>bouleans</i> and what <i><,></i>  or <i>==</i> does.
            Honestly, that is very dry and I vaguely remember most of it from my earlier tries to learn a programming language.
            And I still have several lessons of these basics of programming to work through. 
            I find that kind of tiresome, because you are not doing anything useful in that language, just adding 2+2 or figuring out if 10 == 10 is true or false.
            So to prevent myself from loosing interest, I decided to find myself a small, easy JavaScript project as a challenge and excercise. 
            After a quick google search I found <a href="https://skillcrush.com/blog/projects-you-can-do-with-javascript/">this site.</a><br>

            All of their project seem a tiny bit intimidating to me, as a complete beginner, but they provide you with code for each of the projects, so I want to give it a try.
            I want to use their "Mouseover Element" project as a starting point to figure out how I can make blogposts on this website expand when you hover over them with the cursor.
            So far, I have not started yet, but I will update you on my progress.

            P.S: Note that I used the "<i></i>" tag in HTML here for the first time!
